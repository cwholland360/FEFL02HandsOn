Complete the following within this project.

Within the script.js file, add the following:
Create an object named idealCar
Within the idealCar object, add the following:
a name property with a value of mustang
a color property with a value of red
a weightInPounds property with a value of 3600
a method named myCar that takes each of the values, links them together and console.logs the string My ideal car is a mustang with a color of red, but I do not want it to be over 3600 pounds.
You will need to use the this keyword.
Call the function at the bottom of your file so you can see the console.log running in your console.
Use the http-server to open your project in the web browser.
Right-click on the webpage and click Inspect and then choose console to see your console.log.
Remember, if you make changes, you may have to do a hard reload of your page because you are using the http-server.
